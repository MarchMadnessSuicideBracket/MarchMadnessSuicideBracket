# MarchMadnessSuicideBracket
a site to host Suicide Brackets for NCAA Basketball Tourney in March.

# The Goal:
Each day of the tourney, each user has to pick one team to win that day. Once they use a team, they can't pick that team again through out the tourney. If the user's choice wins they advance to the next day. Otherwise they are eliminated from the tourney. The last user standing wins.

## Plans
Build a  site where someone can buy/obtain a group for the March Madness tourney. They can invite others to join their group to play Suicide Bracket version of March Madness.
